                    It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce,
                    messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes
                    (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus,
                    Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the
                    Sun as viewed from
                    Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western
                    horizon after
                    sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a
                    bright star-like
                    object but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically

                    Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water,
                    mostly by
                    oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which
                    together
                    constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is
                    divided into
                    several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while its
                    interior remains
                    active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a
                    convective mantle
                    that drives plate tectonics.
    
                    Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical
                    regions than polar

            <div class="planet_overview">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the
                Solar System, being larger than only
                Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red
                Planet".
                The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish
                appearance
                distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a
                thin
                atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts
                and polar ice
                caps of Earth.

                The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt
                of the
                rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the
                largest volcano and
                highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest

            <div class="planet_name">Jupiter ♃</div>
            <div class="planet_overview">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
                It is a gas giant with a mass more than
                two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is the
                third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. It
                has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the
                gods, because of
                its massive size.
                <br>
                <br>

                Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium comprises one quarter of its mass and one tenth of
                its volume.   The on-going contraction of its interior generates heat greater than the amount received from
                the Sun. Because
                of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable
                bulge around the
                equator. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, with
                turbulence and
                storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant
                storm that is known
                to have existed since at least the 17th century, when it was first seen by telescope.

            <div class="planet_name">Saturn ♄</div>
            <div class="planet_overview">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar
                System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant
                with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average
                density
                of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after
                the
                Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle. The Romans
                named the
                seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") no later than the 2nd century for the
                planet Saturn.
                <br>
                <br>

                Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen
                compounds). Its core is
                surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid
                helium, and finally
                a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An
                electrical
                current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field,
                which is weaker
                than the Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size.
                Saturn's magnetic
                field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.

            <div class="planet_overview">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek
                god of the sky, Uranus, who, according
                to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father
                of Cronus
                (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar
                System. Uranus is
                similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of
                the larger gas
                giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants"
                to distinguish
                them from the other giant planets. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its
                primary composition
                of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with
                traces of other
                hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System.</div>

                    Earth, slightly
                    more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its
                    greater mass
                    causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. It is named after the Roman god of the sea and
                    has the
                    astronomical symbol ♆, a stylized version of the god Neptune's trident.
    
                    Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by
                    mathematical prediction
                    rather than by empirical observation.Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily
                    of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of
                    hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as water,
                    ammonia and methane.
                    However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;[19] Uranus and Neptune
                    are normally
                    considered "ice giants" to emphasize this distinction.</div>

            <div class="planet_overview">Pluto is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly
                orbiting the Sun. It is the largest known
                trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is
                primarily made
                of ice and rock and is relatively small—one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume. It has
                a moderately
                eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU (4.4–7.4
                billion km) from the
                Sun. This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital
                resonance with
                Neptune prevents them from colliding. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average
                distance</div>
